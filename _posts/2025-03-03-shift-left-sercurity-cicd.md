# 🔐 Shift Left Security in CI/CD Pipelines 

When it comes to modern software development, integrating security early in the CI/CD pipeline—known as **Shift Left Security**—is no longer optional. Rather than treating security as an afterthought, we proactively build it into every stage of development and delivery.

Here’s how we implemented **Shift Left Security** in our CI/CD pipeline, step by step, using real tools and processes.

## 🧑‍💻 1. Local Checks – Pre-Commit & Pre-Push Hooks

Before code even reaches the repository, we enforce checks on the developer’s machine.

### 🔸 Pre-Commit Hook
- **Trigger:** `git commit`
- **Check for:** Secrets, API keys, tokens
- **Action:** Block the commit if secrets are detected with clear error messages

**Tools:**
- [GitLeaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks)
- Custom shell scripts (for specific patterns or formats)

### 🔸 Pre-Push Hook
- **Trigger:** `git push`
- **Check for:** Final secret scanning before pushing
- **Action:** Prevent push if anything sensitive is found

**Example Pre-Push Hook:**
```bash
#!/bin/sh
echo "[Pre-Push] Running GitLeaks for secrets check..."
gitleaks detect --source . --exit-code 1
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ Secrets detected. Push aborted."
  exit 1
fi
echo "✅ No secrets found. Proceeding with push."
```

> 🎯 **Goal:** Prevent secrets and sensitive data from ever reaching the repository.

## 🚀 2. Git Push Triggers CI Pipeline

Once code is pushed to GitHub/GitLab, our CI pipeline initiates.

### a. 🔍 Secret Scanning (Again)
Even though it's done locally, this is a safety net to catch anything missed.

**Tools:**
- GitLeaks
- TruffleHog (optional)

### b. 📦 Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
Scan all dependencies for known vulnerabilities and license risks.

**Tools:**
- [Snyk](https://snyk.io/)
- [OWASP Dependency-Check](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/)

---

## 🛠️ 3. Build, Test & SAST

### a. ✅ Build & Test
- Run unit tests
- Code linting and quality checks

### b. 🧠 Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Analyze source code for security vulnerabilities

**Tools:**
- [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/)
- [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/)

---

## 📦 4. Docker Image Creation

- Build the application into a Docker image
- Use minimal base images and follow secure Dockerfile practices

---

## 🔍 5. Container Image Scanning

Scan the Docker image for:
- Known vulnerabilities
- Secrets embedded in layers
- Misconfigurations

**Tools:**
- Snyk Container
- Trivy
- Grype (optional)

---

## 📤 6. Push to Container Registry

If all scans pass, the image is pushed to:
- DockerHub
- Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- AWS ECR / GCR

---

## ☸️ 7. Deployment

Deploy the application using:
- Kubernetes
- Helm
- GitOps tools like ArgoCD or Flux

---

## 🕵️ 8. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

Post-deployment black-box scanning of the running application.

**Tools:**
- [OWASP ZAP](https://owasp.org/www-project-zap/)
- Burp Suite (Advanced)
- Nuclei (optional)

---


### 🧩 9. Runtime Security
Monitor live apps for anomalies and unauthorized behavior.

**Tools:**
- Falco
- Sysdig
- Kubernetes PSPs or Admission Controllers

---


## 🏁 Conclusion

Shift Left Security isn’t about burdening developers—it's about empowering them to catch issues early. This automated, layered approach saves time, enhances security, and protects your application across its lifecycle.
